Concept:
    software design for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program.

Parts:
    Thread_Pool_Manager: initialize threads, start and stop threads, schedualer, manage the pool
    Working_Thread: threads
    Task_Socket: socket for tasks
    Task_Queue: Store unprocessed tasks and be able to schedule and manage the priority of tasks

4 Conditions:
    No Task
    The number of tasks in the queue is smaller than or equal to the threads in the pool
    The number of tasks is greater than the capacoty of the thead Thread_Pool. The buffer queue is not full
    The number of tasks is greater than the capacoty of the thead Thread_Pool. The buffer queue is full
